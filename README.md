# Bison-Yacc-Flex Programming Language

## Overview
This project is a custom programming language developed using Bison, Yacc, and (F)lex. The language supports a variety of data types and allows for complex operations and function definitions.

## Features
- **Data Types**: Supports int, float, char, bool, and string data types.
- **Functions**: Allows defining functions with different parameter types.
- **Operations**: Supports arithmetic and logical operations.
- **Control Structures**: Includes control structures such as if-else, while, and for loops.
- **Arrays**: Supports arrays for int, float, and char data types.
- **Custom Types**: Allows defining new types with the 'newType' keyword.
- **Variable Management**: The language can handle variable declaration, initialization, and assignment. It also supports constant variables.
- **Error Handling**: The language includes error handling for variable declaration and assignment.

## Technologies
This project is implemented using several technologies:

- **Bison**: A parser generator that is part of the GNU Project. Bison reads a specification of a context-free language, warns about any parsing ambiguities, and generates a parser (either in C, C++, or Java) which reads sequences of tokens and decides whether the sequence conforms to the syntax specified by the grammar.

- **Yacc (Yet Another Compiler-Compiler)**: A computer program for the Unix operating system developed by AT&T. It is a Look Ahead Left-to-Right (LALR) parser generator, generating a parser, the part of a compiler that tries to make syntactic sense of the source code, specifically a LALR parser, based on an analytic grammar written in a notation similar to Backus-Naur Form (BNF).

- **(F)lex**: A tool for generating scanners: programs which recognized lexical patterns in text. (F)lex reads the given input files, or its standard input if no file names are given, for a description of a scanner to generate.
